# **Fitness Tracker**

## Description

This MERN app was created to help keep track of your fitness goals and workouts. Making use of RESTful API's, the user is able to send data to a database and the website will track and render that data out across the app. React, Bootstrap, Express, and Mongo were the major tech stack elements used to create the application.

## Installation

Heroku was the hosting service that made the most sense for this project. You can find the deployed version here: [Fitness Tracker](https://fitness-tracker-server-44fdd70c95d7.herokuapp.com/)
